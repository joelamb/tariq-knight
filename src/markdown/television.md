###  The Sorcerer’s Apprentice

Take 14 uncoordinated children, chuck them into a castle, give them a magic teacher, two weeks to learn magic, and see who will strive to get voted the _Sorcerer’s Apprentice_. This magical battle of the sexes sees Tariq mentor his seven-strong team of boys against an equally ambitious team of girls.

Will Tariq have the patience to teach his group of boys, and will he be the teacher with the winning student…?

### _Freaky_
The sketch and magic show that aired on Channel 4 sees Tariq performing his most up-to-date _Freaky_ magic. From milking his nipple, to stripping naked on the streets of Bath for his prediction trick, this show will make you see magic from a new perspective.

Tariq flies across a hotel room like superman, pulls objects out of a television screen, and conjures bespoke items from an empty bag. His electricity-less light bulb routine even takes on a macabre new twist when, after luring his audience to a graveyard, the inexplicably glowing bulb’s explosion is proceeded by the terrifying appearance of the Devil.

It’s not magic… it's _Freaky_!

### _Playing Tricks_
This hidden camera magic comedy show, described as a cross between David Blaine and _Trigger Happy TV_, sees a team of tricksters hit the streets to baffle and bamboozle the public. The show sees Tariq…

 - Make a person appear from a folded newspaper
 - Miraculously lean at 90 degrees without falling over
 - Turn toilet paper into a tenner
 - Produce household pets from a small wallet
 - Is anyone safe now that the _Playing Tricks_ crew has been unleashed in London?

The popular show was Trouble TV’s highest-rated show the year it was aired and repeats continue to screen on FTN and Challenge TV.

#### Tariq has appeared on several chat shows.
From competing on BBC’s _Celebrity Ready Steady Cook_ to providing funny interviews for Channel 5’s _When Magic Goes Horribly Wrong_, Tariq can be seen appearing on numerous magic related TV shows throughout the year.
