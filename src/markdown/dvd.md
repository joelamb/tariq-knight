If you’re a magic nut (like a pecan… or a macadamia) or you just enjoy freaking people out, this will be right up your garden path. Learn how to pull out your heart, pop out your eyeball and even get to grips with one of the world’s most dangerous card tricks.

See Tariq bring his gruesome tricks to the street before presenting his step-by-step guide to mastering the routine and becoming a professional sicko!
